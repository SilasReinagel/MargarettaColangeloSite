                    <p>Margaretta in a word is awesome. I have been fortunate to know her for a number of years and
                        work with her on startups and non-profits. We serve on six advisory boards together and I
                        hear nothing but high praise for her work effort and strong ethics. Margaretta is
                        intelligent and creative. She works hard and smart. She thinks long-term and has an innate
                        ability to execute on near-term projects which will lead to future success. She's a constant
                        learner and reader which leads her to explore and find connections which are pertinent but
                        were not previously thought of by others. When she works on a project, she focuses on it but
                        also allows her mind to think through other permutations about how it could be done.
                        Margaretta doesn't seek the spotlight. She works well with other people and she isn't
                        looking for the limelight.</p>

                        people I have ever met. She has high levels of IQ + EQ + LQ + Erudition + Energy + Charisma.
                        She also has high levels of personal performance, dedication, and focus. She is the best
                        partner and friend to have when you want to convert a bold idea that others consider
                        undoable, unthinkable, and impossible, into reality. With Margaretta, it actually becomes a

                        There are few people who grasp future trends the way she does. My reading list has also
                        become full of new books on AI and emerging technologies because of her. Margaretta serves
                        on the Advisory Board of the AI Precision Health Institute that I co-founded at the University of Hawai‘i Cancer Center. Cheers Margaretta! </p>

                    <p>If there was a Nobel Prize for excellence in producing and sharing COVID knowledge, Margaretta Colangelo would win it hands down. In fact, Stockholm should probably make note of her just in case. Since January 2020 she has been tirelessly pumping out great medical, scientific, and technical research on COVID-19. The amount, frequency, and quality of data, papers, studies, information, and news coming from Margaretta is nothing short of extraordinary. She’s at her best when illuminating the intersection of AI and COVID. It's fascinating how she takes different threads of research to create an amazing picture of this super-deadly virus in all of its subtle, killing ways and disguises, and how science, like some great global COVID posse, is chasing it down. Collectively, her postings are like a new-age version of Paul de Kruif’s Microbe Hunters - remember that classic book? However, Margaretta’s aren't stories written in hindsight; hers are happening in the here and now, and she takes us along on the hunt. She’s become my go-to source for everything COVID. The work that pours out of her matters a helluva lot to a world scared to death of living in constant fear of plague. She’s amazing. You should check her out.</p>

                    <p> I first met Margaretta over lunch with Kevin Perrott at a restaurant with a panoramic view of North Marin. The view sticks in my mind because talking to Margaretta is like sitting on top of a hill looking out in all directions at science, the biology of aging, literature, networks, cryptocurrency, AI, San Francisco history, and a plethora of other topics she knows a LOT about. She mentions a lot of names in our conversations, not to impress me but simply because she collects people who she feels are doing worthwhile work and she wants them to know – or at least know OF – each other. Margaretta is an enthusiastic conversationalist – but it never feels like a lecture, and when I feel moved to contribute something, she locks into what I’m saying with full focus and stillness as if she is memorizing every word; it can feel like the first time anyone has really listened to you. Years later I have no doubt that she could recall what we discussed the first time we met. In addition to the many things I’ve learned from Margaretta directly over the years, I also follow her closely on LinkedIn (like literally thousands of others) and read her articles summarizing vast quantities of research in many areas of science and technology; lately it’s been COVID-19 of course. I’ve come to realize that Margaretta is not just a remarkable person, she’s also a remarkably useful person, a master connector à la Malcolm Gladwell’s Tipping Point, and that simply by knowing her there are countless experts in various disciplines who I didn’t need to know personally – because I can always reach them through Margaretta if necessary, or – even better – just have her summarize their research for me!</p>

Researchers of all kinds are finding her posts full of information that is critical for life on earth post pandemic. The posts that she has shared from the time that COVID-19 first surfaced until now are TOP CLASS knowledge enriching posts. I can imagine the efforts she has taken to extract useful information and publish it while keeping readers of all kinds in mind. The words "thank you" are just not enough to acknowledge her for her efforts. We all are grateful to her. I will continue to read her posts until we have victory over COVID 19. Her mission is to serve humanity with her knowledge in all diverse fields so that well informed decisions are taken by individuals, researchers, hospitals, AI firms, pharma companies, and governments.

                    <p>Margaretta and I have worked together and attended tech events together for several years. We've discussed everything from our interests, to the future, to the potential of the

                        University and while the event was full of interesting people, the person who really
                        shined to me was Margaretta. By the end of the day I felt like I'd known Margaretta forever.

                        lives. I will always remember something profound Margaretta said to me. She said "When I hear
                        people say that they wouldn't want to live longer, I always think that their perspective would
                        change very quickly if they faced a life-threatening event". Needless to say, all those who meet
                        Margaretta are immediately refreshed by her lively and positive outlook on life because she

                        name a few. Even more inspiring, is Margaretta taking the lead to form advanced networks,
                        alliances, and coalitions such as this think tank to make all this possible. In this light,
                        we've discussed integrating two promising technology applications - AI and Blockchain- into one
                        monster solution across markets and industries. Writing this and in introspection, it's amazing
                        to me that we accomplished all this in an hour and a half. Think what we could do with years and

                    <p>When I was a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, I reached out to Margaretta for help securing an
                        internship at fashion company Narciso Rodriguez. I loved to design, but I had no idea how to
                        break into the fashion industry, especially while still in high school. Thanks to Margaretta's
                        help, I was able to secure an internship at Narciso Rodriguez, which led to many amazing
                        opportunities and really solidified my desire to work in the industry. Since then, I've even
                        launched my own company, all stemming from the support I received from Margaretta. Margaretta is
                        the Empress of all things Tech.</p>
