                       include AI, advanced biomedicine, and blockchain. We see the potential of advanced technologies to 
                       combat some of the world's most serious problems including poverty, exploitation, corruption and 
                       disease, and to transform healthcare and education. Like a natural ecosystem, our community consists

                            <p>In tech companies, thinking is the primary activity and the core process used to create value. 
                               One of the challenges when thinking about technology is keeping up with constant innovation and 
                               envisioning what will evolve next. To stay abreast of emerging technologies, I've built this  
                               think tank of investors, entrepreneurs, researchers, and engineers around the world who have 
                               progressive ideas. Like a natural ecosystem, our ecosystem consists of interlinked resources that 
                               complement each other. As the community expands, it's value increases exponentially for everyone 
                               in it. These are some of the people with whom I collaborate regularly.</p>

                        <p>Margaretta in a word is awesome. I have been fortunate to know her for a number 
                           of years and work with her on startups and non-profits. We serve on six advisory
                           boards together and I hear nothing but high praise for her work effort and strong ethics.
                           Margaretta is intelligent and creative. She works hard and smart. She thinks long-term and 
                           has an innate ability to execute on near-term projects which will lead to future success.
                           She's a constant learner and reader which leads her to explore and find connections which 
                           are pertinent but were not previously thought of by others. When she works on a project, 
                           she focuses on it but also allows her mind to think through other permutations about how 
                           it could be done. Margaretta doesn't seek the spotlight. She works well with other people 
                           and she isn't looking for the limelight.</p>

                      She also has high levels of personal performance, dedication, and focus. She is the best partner

                           about many things. I admire her intelligence, business acumen, perseverance and excellence in 
                           literally everything she does, and I am convinced that it stems from her love for her fellow humans. 
                           She is interested in finding a cure for aging and disease, and improving overall health using cutting 
                           edge technologies (blockchain, AI) - this is all very much in line with my thinking. She is an incredibly 
                           interesting and interested individual. I was stunned by the extensive collection of all the right books 
                           she owns which leaves no doubt of the above. By supporting, advising, mentoring, and propelling gifted

                        <p>Margaretta is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met, and her ethics are sterling. 
                           Margaretta and I ​met in 1997 ​when I was ​CEO of​ Advanced Web Technologies ​​​in New York City. 
                           I recruited her to be Director of Sales at our company on Wall Street in New York City.
                           Margaretta was the single most successful sales director in our company history. Her tireless 
                           and laser focused efforts and professionalism brought us tremendous business and amazing new clients. 
                           She single handedly brought in major accounts including: Barclay's Global, JP Morgan, NCR, Standard and 
                           Poor's, Teradata, MITRE, Countrywide Financial, Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Portland Gas & Electric, 
                           Pennsylvania State University, JBoss and Red Hat. Our company flourished under her sales leadership. 
                           I wholeheartedly recommend Margaretta. She's not just a star, she's more like a quasar!</p>

                        <p>Margaretta is an inspirational collaborator and perseverant inquisitor. Our discussions range from the
                           mainstream to the fringe and back again - ranging from quantum physics and the holistic approach for
                           therapeutics to quantum medicine that underlies our basic understanding of systems biology (toxicology
                           by sequelae) that will evolve to precision medicine. Margaretta is a rarity in today's world as 
                           most of us are trained to drill down into our disciplines to observe a singularity. I am grateful

                           AI/ML, and other emerging technologies could drastically reduce the 15-17 years it takes medical 
                           science to go “from bench to bedside,” putting new treatments into life-saving clinical practice. We

                        <p>Margaretta understands and values humanity. She puts humanity before money. She is one of best 
                           people I know. We have the same line of thinking, approach, mission and vision. When two 
                           positive people meet, something positive happens. Margaretta and I are working together to 
                           improve the lives of millions of people around the world. I have had a dream to transform 
                           the lives of people from all villages across India and through all castes. Margaretta and I have 
                           a vision of positive transformation for humanity through the convergence of advanced technology. 
                           We believe that women's financial inclusion is essential and will bring positive development 
                           in families and in society. We are working to improve healthcare, increase financial inclusion, 
                           empower women, improve the lives of children, and to improve education at all levels from primary 
                           through university. Margaretta and I are kindred spirits working together to create big 
                           improvements for all human beings.</p>

                        <p>Margaretta and I met at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and instantly 
                           connected on our visions for living healthier and longer lives. We are both passionate about 
                           translating scientific breakthroughs into the clinic and we understand that healthy longevity is 
                           now more of an engineering challenge than it ever was. We both agree that more needs to be done 
                           in the way of educating the general public on the promise brought forth by living longer and more 
                           enjoyable lives. I will always remember something profound Margaretta said to me. She said "When I hear 
                           people say that they wouldn't want to live longer, I always think that their perspective would change
                           very quickly if they faced a life-threatening event". Needless to say, all those who meet Margaretta 
                           are immediately refreshed by her lively and positive outlook on life because she truly enjoys life. 
                           I am proud to say I understand that feeling.</p>

                        <p>In my first conversation with Margaretta, we found, in common, core values of freedom and liberty. 
                           These values drive our passionate advocacy of technologies that will advance freedoms and liberties 
                           to all people around the world to help them solve some of the biggest problems of humanity such as 
                           wealth inequality, disease, energy, food production, and the environment, to name a few. Even more 
                           inspiring, is Margaretta taking the lead to form advanced networks, alliances, and coalitions such as 
                           this think tank to make all this possible. In this light, we've discussed integrating two promising 
                           technology applications - AI and Blockchain- into one monster solution across markets and industries. 
                           Writing this and in introspection, it's amazing to me that we accomplished all this in an hour and a 
                           half. Think what we could do with years and hundreds of like-minded souls. In the future, I can't

                           generosity and good-will inspires her to provide professional advice and suggestions. This all stems 
                           from her desire to see all the people who she believes in succeed. This testimonial in itself will 
                           not be able to adequately convey just how amazing she is, however, all one needs to do is read the

                        <p>Margaretta is one of the most valuable and tireless people working to integrate 
                           networks and link like-minded individuals. As a sophomore in college, I reached 
                           out to Margaretta for advice during my internship search. I was interested in 
                           research and government, but wanted more information about specific positions. 
                           She not only connected me to other prep school alumni with relevant previous 
                           experience, but encouraged my informational interview requests and gave me her support. 
                           Margaretta believes in getting to know people, and I am grateful for her enthusiasm 
                           and help in exploring career paths.</p>

                           overall understanding of the entire company was invaluable to the team at Open Horizon. 
                           All early stage companies need someone like Margaretta to help keep the team organized,

                           crucial advice on AI projects, start-up funding and strategy, while providing her with my take 
                           on the French and Spanish innovation scenes. Having worked in some of the world’s most vibrant 
                           Biotech hubs (Boston, San Francisco and Barcelona), I know how important it is to surround yourself 
                           with doers, like Margaretta, rather than just talkers. Chatting with her is a refreshing reminder

                        <p>When I was a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, I reached out to Margaretta for help securing 
                           an internship at fashion company Narciso Rodriguez. I loved to design, but I had no idea how to 
                           break into the fashion industry, especially while still in high school. Thanks to Margaretta's help, 
                           I was able to secure an internship at Narciso Rodriguez, which led to many amazing opportunities and 
                           really solidified my desire to work in the industry. Since then, I've even launched my own company, all 
                           stemming from the support I received from Margaretta. Margaretta is the Empress of all things Tech.</p>
