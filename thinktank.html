                    <p>Margaretta in a word is awesome. I have been fortunate to know her for a number of years and
                        work with her on startups and non-profits. We serve on six advisory boards together and I
                        hear nothing but high praise for her work effort and strong ethics. Margaretta is
                        intelligent and creative. She works hard and smart. She thinks long-term and has an innate
                        ability to execute on near-term projects which will lead to future success. She's a constant
                        learner and reader which leads her to explore and find connections which are pertinent but
                        were not previously thought of by others. When she works on a project, she focuses on it but
                        also allows her mind to think through other permutations about how it could be done.
                        Margaretta doesn't seek the spotlight. She works well with other people and she isn't
                        looking for the limelight.</p>

                        people I have ever met. She has high levels of IQ + EQ + LQ + Erudition + Energy + Charisma.
                        She also has high levels of personal performance, dedication, and focus. She is the best
                        partner and friend to have when you want to convert a bold idea that others consider
                        undoable, unthinkable, and impossible, into reality. With Margaretta, it actually becomes a

                        There are few people who grasp future trends the way she does. My reading list has also
                        become full of new books on AI and emerging technologies because of her. Margaretta serves

                        and excellence in literally everything she does, and I am convinced that it stems from her
                        love for her fellow humans. She is interested in finding a cure for aging and disease, and
                        improving overall health using cutting edge technologies (blockchain, AI) - this is all very
                        much in line with my thinking. She is an incredibly interesting and interested individual. I
                        was stunned by the extensive collection of all the right books she owns which leaves no
                        doubt of the above. By supporting, advising, mentoring, and propelling gifted and prodigious
                        youth, she is forming the next generation right before our eyes. I am beyond excited and

                        sterling. Margaretta and I met in 1997 when I was CEO of Advanced Web Technologies in
                        New York City. I recruited her to be Director of Sales at our company on Wall Street in New
                        York City. Margaretta was the single most successful sales director in our company history.
                        Her tireless and laser focused efforts and professionalism brought us tremendous business
                        and amazing new clients. She single handedly brought in major accounts including: Barclay's
                        Global, JP Morgan, NCR, Standard and Poor's, Teradata, MITRE, Countrywide Financial,
                        Enterprise Rent-a-Car, Portland Gas & Electric, Pennsylvania State University, JBoss and Red

                        an engineering challenge than it ever was. We both agree that more needs to be done in the way

                        lives. I will always remember something profound Margaretta said to me. She said "When I hear
                        people say that they wouldn't want to live longer, I always think that their perspective would
                        change very quickly if they faced a life-threatening event". Needless to say, all those who meet

                        break into the fashion industry, especially while still in high school. Thanks to Margaretta's
                        help, I was able to secure an internship at Narciso Rodriguez, which led to many amazing
                        opportunities and really solidified my desire to work in the industry. Since then, I've even

                    <p>Margaretta is a strong believer in the future of the human race. I had the pleasure of meeting
                        her through our shared interests for AI, VR, and philosophy. Her progressive beliefs, which I
                        share, reveal her unwavering passion to extend the technological limits of our world. Her energy
                        and optimism are infectious, and her kindness inspires me to learn more about the many things we
                        discuss. I am very impressed by the existence of her network of passionate individuals, and look
                        forward to working with members of her ecosystem.</p>
